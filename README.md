###### Kedarnath

Every year thousands of devotees come to the Kedarnath Dham in order to attain moksha. Kedarnath is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva. **Kedarnath Yatra is a well-known pilgrimage destination for Chota Char Dham** and home to the Kedarnath Temple. We can see a beautiful snow fall over there and we should trek for 24KMS from **Gourikund to Kedarnath** .

The places to cover in Kedarnath are:

**KedarnathMandir**

**Gauri Kund**

**Bhairav Nath Temple**
